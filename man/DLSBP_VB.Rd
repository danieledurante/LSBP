\usage{
DLSBP_VB(y, X, H = 2, maxiter = 1000, prior = NULL, tol = 1e-04,
  seed = NULL, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{a vector containing the response vector}

\item{X}{a n x p design matrix containing the covariates}

\item{H}{an integer indicating the number of mixture components}

\item{maxiter}{an integer indicating the maximum number of iterations for the EM algorithm}

\item{prior}{a list containing prior hyperparameters (See details for a detailed description). If not provided, the MLE is computed.}

\item{tol}{a real number controlling the convergence criterium}

\item{seed}{set the seed, for reproducibility since the initialization is random}

\item{verbose}{Logical: Should the logposterior be displayed while the algorithm is running?}
}
\value{
The output is a list containing the following quantities
\itemize{
\item \verb{beta}. A (H - 1) x p matrix containing the beta coefficients.
\item \verb{mu}. A H dimensional vector containing the mu coefficients.
\item \verb{tau}. A H dimensional vector containing the tau coefficients.
\item \verb{pred}. A n dimensional vector containing the the predicted values.
\item \verb{cluster}. A n dimensional vector containing, for each observation, the mixture component having with the highest probability.
\item \verb{z}. A n x H matrix containing the probabilities of belonging to each of the mixture components.
\item \verb{logposterior}. The logposterior of the given model at convergence.

\description{
The dependent logistic stick-breaking process (DLSBP) model estimated through  Variational Bayes (VB).
}
\details{
The prior argument is a list which should contains the following elements
\itemize{
\item \verb{b}. A p dimensional vector containing the prior mean of the Gaussian beta coefficients
\item \verb{B}. A p x p matrix representing the prior covariance of the Gaussian beta coefficients.
\item \verb{mu_mu}. A real number representing the prior mean for the kernel mean.
\item \verb{tau_mu}. A positive number representing the precision for the kernel mean.
\item \verb{a_tau}, \verb{b_tau}. The hyperparameters of a Gamma prior distribution for the kernel precision.
